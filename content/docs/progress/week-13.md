## What have I done?

This week, as planned, I worked on crawler. In particular, I have updated to code to download the metadata information, such as copyright information about the publication. In addition to updating the code, I also created a pull request and resolved the review comments. Further to working on the crawler, I also worked on improving the ecosystem diagram.

In addition, I worked on transcribing the video from BICAN workshops using OpenAI Whisper mode. The transcribed texts are available in [Sensein Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zLIPi50dmROANIZsmI5nQcGXr_XIDCUA?usp=drive_link). Apart from transcribing text and improving the crawling code, I also worked on KG validation, generating the necessary skeleton and unit tests.

Moreover, I organized a meeting with Ontotext to discuss GraphDB. I also held an internal meeting with the Sensein team to review the architecture, during which we decided to use NextJS for the UI.


## What is the result?

The major results of this week are as follows:

- Updated the ecosystem diagram to improve the readibility.
- Updated the code to crawl the Biorxiv publications to dowload the metadata information.
- Crawled and downloaded 41K publications from Biorxiv relating to neuroscience and their corresponding metadata information.
- Addressed the reviewed comments and merged the created pull request. 
- Transcribed BICAN workshop videos.
- Implemented basic functionalities required for KG validator and generated the corresponding unit tests.
