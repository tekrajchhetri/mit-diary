## Overview

The plan for week 9 is to improve the web application's first basic view and connect multiple models, GARS, NIMP and ANSRS.  Additionally, the plan is to deploy the application.

## What have I done?

As planned this week, I worked on improving and completing the implementation following the feedback from the lab meeting and other members of the BICAN project. The web application now lets visualize all the connected components between NIMP, GARS and ANSRS, if any.

Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 display the information from the knowledge graphs in our web application. The web application has been deployed at AWS and can be accessed at [http://18.191.20.10:8000/](http://18.191.20.10:8000/).

In addition to implementing the improved version of the application and deploying it to AWS, I also worked on the work plan and milestones for our new intern and contributed to the workshop presentation. The work plan document is available on [Google Drive](https://shorturl.at/uGbpD).


## What is the result?

The following are the major outcomes of this week.

- Basic visualization has improved by incorporating feedback from the lab/project members.
- Deployment of the web application to AWS.
