## Overview

The plan for week 12 is to consolidate the feedback received during the BICAN workshop, participate in weekly meetings with the intern who's working on BrainKB with me, finalize the design document, and work on BrainKB.

## What have I done?

This week, as planned, I worked on BrainKB, the design document, and other related works. In particular, I created a new ecosystem diagram for BrainKB. The diagram provides all the key information regarding BrainKB, such as the principles and tasks it supports. Figure 1 shows the BrainKB ecosystem diagram.

## What is the result?

In addition to working on the design document, I reviewed the strategy for constructing the KGs and data annotation strategy and tested the LLMs for entity extraction. Details are accessible via presentations on the [Sensein Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WjFh6fWgotVYBEQkayrZzJvSaxVpDZiZ/view?usp=drive_link).

Moreover, I also worked on crawling scientific publications, which are to be used for KG construction from the text, provided feedback on the work of Jai, one of the interns working with me on BrainKB and submitted abstract to INCF. 

## What is the result?

The major results of this week are as follows:

- Created a new ecosystem diagram that highlights all the features and principles of the BrainKB.
- Crawled and downloaded 2K publications from Biorxiv.
- Reviewed different strategies regarding data KG construction from text and tested LLMs for entity extraction and KG construction.
