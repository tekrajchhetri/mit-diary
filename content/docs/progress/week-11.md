## What have I done?

This week, I spent most of my time attending the BICAN workshop, where I learned more about neuroscience and the works of different BICAN consortium members. Moreover, I had the opportunity to meet the individuals I had been collaborating with online in person.

Additionally, I received feedback (e.g., entity card) on the BrainKB work and the knowledge base in general that other consortium members are also working on.


## What is the result?

The main achievement this week is familiarizing myself with the work of fellow members and the feedback received during the workshop.
